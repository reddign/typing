computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks
it involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages
programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code
machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation
data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks
high-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware
FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957
compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code
readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of source code
Big O notation expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input
the first known actual bug causing a problem in a computer was a moth, trapped inside a Harvard mainframe
