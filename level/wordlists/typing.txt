hunt and peck is a common form of typing in which the typist presses each key individually
when touch typing, the typist keeps their eyes on the source copy at all times
touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists rest their wrist down, rather than lifting up and typing
keyboard shortcuts allow the user to edit their document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse
according to one study, the number of fingers does not determine typing speed
fast typists keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter
a late 20th century trend in typing, primarily used with devices with small keyboards, is thumbing or thumb typing
thumb typing can be accomplished using either only one thumb or both the thumbs, with more proficient typists reaching speeds of 100 words per minute
words per minute (WPM) is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in recruitment
for the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes
an average professional typist reaches 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 wpm, and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm
