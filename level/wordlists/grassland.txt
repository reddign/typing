grassland habitats are places that receive more rain than deserts but less precipitation than forests
most of the plants here are grasses, which donâ€™t need as much water as forest vegetation
many grasslands were formed tens of thousands of years ago after the last ice age, when the Earth began to warm up and the climate became drier
grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica and are found in most ecoregions of the Earth
grasslands are one of the largest biomes on Earth and dominate the landscape worldwide
despite growing recognition of the importance of grasslands, understanding of restoration options remains limited
successful grassland restoration has several dimensions, including recognition in policy, scientific innovation, and data sharing
the professional study of dry grasslands falls under the category of rangeland management
