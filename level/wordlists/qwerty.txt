the QWERTY layout was devised and created in the early 1870s by Christopher Latham Sholes
the QWERTY layout became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878
alternating hands while typing is a desirable trait in a keyboard design
thousands of English words can be spelled using only the left hand, while only a couple of hundred words can be typed using only the right hand
contrary to popular belief, the QWERTY layout was not designed to slow the typist down, but rather to speed up typing
aside from the issue of jamming, placing often-used keys farther apart increases typing speed, because it encourages alternation between the hands
the keys do not form a rectangular grid, but rather each column slants diagonally
only the vowel letter A is on the home row, which requires the typist's fingers to leave the home row for most words
the 1 and exclamation point were left off some typewriter keyboards into the 1970s
